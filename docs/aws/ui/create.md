## Cluster Deployment

After all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster.

Here is a **basic flow for cluster creation on Cloudbreak Web UI**:

 - Start by selecting a previously created AWS credential in the header.
 - Open `create cluster`

`Configure Cluster` tab

 - Fill out the new cluster `name`
    - Cluster name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character then you can apply lowercase alphanumeric and 
   hyphens only (min 5, max 40 characters)
 - Select a `Region` where you like your cluster be provisioned
 - Click on the `Setup Network and Security` button
>If `Public in account` is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the created cluster on
 the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.

`Setup Network and Security` tab

 - Select one of the security groups
 - Click on the `Choose Blueprint` button
>If `Enable security` is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will 
be Kerberized. See more about it in the [Kerberos](kerberos.md) section of this documentation.

`Choose Blueprint` tab

 - Select one of the blueprint
 - After you've selected a `Blueprint`, you should be able to configure:
    - the templates
    - the securitygroups
    - the number of nodes for all of the host groups in the blueprint
 - You need to select where you want to install the Ambari server to. Only 1 host group can be selected.
   If you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group
   which contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so 
   it is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.
 - Click on the `Review and Launch` button

`Review and Launch` tab

 - After the `create and start cluster` button has clicked Cloudbreak will start to create the cluster's resources on 
 your AWS account.

Cloudbreak uses *CloudFormation* to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on 
the AWS Console CloudFormation page.

Besides these you can check the progress on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself if you open the new cluster's `Event History`.

#### Advanced Options

There are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:

`Ambari Username` This user will be used as admin user in Ambari. You can log in using this username on the Ambari UI.

`Ambari Password` The password associated with the Ambari username. This password will be also the default password for all required passwords which are not specified in the blueprint. E.g: hive DB password.

`Availability Zone` You can restrict the instances to a [specific availability zone](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html). It may be useful if you're using
 reserved instances.

`Use dedicated instances` You can use [dedicated instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/dedicated-instances/) on EC2

`Minimum cluster size` The provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes.

`Validate blueprint` This is selected by default. Cloudbreak validates the Ambari blueprint in this case.

`Config recommendation strategy` Strategy for configuration recommendations how will be applied. Recommended 
configurations gathered by the response of the stack advisor. 

* `NEVER_APPLY`               Configuration recommendations are ignored with this option.
* `ONLY_STACK_DEFAULTS_APPLY` Applies only on the default configurations for all included services.
* `ALWAYS_APPLY`              Applies on all configuration properties.

`Seamless S3 Access` Cluster will be able to reach S3 buckets without any configuration.

* `Disable S3 Access By Default`               Cluster will not be able to reach S3 buckets.
* `Create Role For S3 Access`                  The Cloudformation template will create a new role and assign to every instance.
* `Define Existing Role For S3 Access`         Cluster will use the predefined instance role. You should define the role ARN in the `Role for S3 connection` box.

`Hostgroup Configuration` During the hostgroup config we support different security groups per hostgroup.

`Configure Ambari Database` In case you have an existing DB (like RDS) you can reuse it
