## Cluster Termination

You can terminate running or stopped clusters with

```
stack delete --name myawsstack
```
Other available option is `--wait` - in this case the terminate command will return only after the process has finished. 

>**IMPORTANT:** Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the 
CloudFormation stack first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!

Sometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't
 be terminated. In this case the `Forced termination` option on the Cloudbreak Web UI can help to terminate the cluster
  at the Cloudbreak side. **If it has happened:**

1. You should check the related resources at the AWS CloudFormation
2. If it is needed you need to manually remove resources from there
